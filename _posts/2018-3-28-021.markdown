When my son’s football team won the state championship it actually surprised me! The team they were playing was really good. I found myself crying… at a football game. That’s something I never thought would happen! Their team won by a single point, and honestly, I think my son was just as surprised as I was!

Both my sons are my proudest accomplishments. They always will be. I don’t know that I can take the credit for how they’ve turned out, but it makes me so proud to see them be kind, even when they don’t think I notice. Especially when they’re kind to each other, which is hard for teenage brothers! I’m really blessed to have them.
