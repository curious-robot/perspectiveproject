I’ve lived here for 17 years; my whole life. I like it... but I’ve traveled a lot, so I’ve been able to see and experience places I might like better. I’ve been to every state except for Hawaii and Alaska. I’ve gone on three road trips out west, and a trip to Maine, and a lot of others in between. So far, Washington and Oregon (and Colorado) are my favorite places in the country. Honestly, nothing is really keeping me here in Murphy except the fact that I can’t leave. After high school, though, I’m going to college in either Asheville or Colorado. And after that, I’m moving to Washington. I love the forests of Washington, and the beaches there. The difference between Murphy and there is… outrageous.
