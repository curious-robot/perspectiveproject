I just had my 41st wedding anniversary, and I’m proud of that. I also got to go to college. That was an accomplishment, too. And I taught school for 25 years, and I think I touched some lives through that. I taught shop, so it was a hands on experience. I love people, so I felt like I made a difference in how I interacted with my students. I love work. I love to accomplish things. I love seeing other people do that, too. I guess my passion in life is to accomplish things. Most peoples’ passion is to work long enough to take a vacation. But I’m retired and I still work all the time!
