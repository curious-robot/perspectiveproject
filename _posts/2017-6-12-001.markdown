Started coming here in the morning to have coffee with all the guys. We started when Dave Johnson came to town from Florida and put in the coffee shop out on the corner. I was working at the police department at the time.

Back in the 60s, 70s, and 80s, on Friday and Saturday night it was bumper-to-bumper on main street. We had kids riding up and down through town. They’d drive up and down through town all night. They'd sit on the side of parking lanes. Never had that much trouble with all these kids. Just walk by and tell ‘em “alright get your beer, put it back in your car, don’t let me see it again," or "get your beer, pour it out on the sidewalk, and throw the can in the car. Pour a little in the car, let your daddy take care of it in the morning, when he gets in to go to church.” We used to do stuff like that all the time. We had a lot of fun. Everybody knew us and we knew them. Kids and everything. And if you had one misbehaving you just put him in the car and took him home. We knew where every one of them lived. Then you'd drop ‘em off, tell their dad or mom “car’s up town, here’s the keys.”
