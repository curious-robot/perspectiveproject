My four-year-old daughter is definitely my proudest accomplishment. Not just having creating her, because that’s easy, but seeing the daily pay-off of the frustrating moments. The rewards of having her tell me “sorry dad. Did you see that dad? I listened this time and didn’t that make you happy?” It’s sweet, and rewarding. It’s like having a beautiful plant that you have to water with your self.

This is our meeting spot when I meet her grandma to swap her between me and her mom. This place is old fashioned, you can just sit here and talk. There was a dude sitting over there smoking a cigar last time and my daughter was like “do you remember me?” and he was like “I remember you from last time and the time before, too.” When my daughter got out the car this time she just walked over and sat at the table with those two guys who remember her and was like “hey guys, I’m just waiting for my grandma.” And they both just started laughing, and they talked for about ten minutes. The woman inside knows what she wants, what type of ice cream flavor she likes.

I like it when she comes. It’s just me and her. I get her at least twice a month, for different amounts of time, but always at least three days. This past time I had it all lined up so I had her since the this whole month. Today I dropped her off. This was my coffee to drink before I hit the road.
