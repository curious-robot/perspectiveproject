Ordained ministry took about four years to complete. It wasn’t particularly easy; I had to have a battery of psychological tests, and theological tests. I’m incredibly grateful to have passed all that, and I wouldn’t want to go back through. But it was worth it. I love being a pastor to this church and this community. I know I’ve only been here four months, but I really like it here and I want to be here for a while. 

I get to talk about Jesus and tell people why He’s awesome. For me, there’s nothing better than that. There’s always those things that you think are important in life but honestly, they’re really not. The things that matter are Christ and His ways. Who you’re dating, where you go to college, how much money you make: those things matter, but at the end of the day, if that’s all you care about, life is pointless.
