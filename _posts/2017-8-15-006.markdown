I’ve been homeless for almost 2 months now. I’ve been homeless before so it’s not a huge deal, but I really need to find a place to stay. I’m saving up for a house or apartment by working at a farm. It’s pretty much just cutting and stacking collards. I did that up until I got shot about a year ago, and I couldn’t work for a while, but now I’m working again.

I got shot by a friend, actually. It was pretty bad. The bullet went right through my neck. They had to do surgery and I was in the hospital for 12 days. I could have died. My friend and I, we had a few issues. When it happened, everybody was on drugs… and I just got shot. It was almost a year ago now…

I’ve been doing some reading recently, though; I’ve been reading the Airman. It’s a novel about the life of a man who flies airplanes, and I like that I can relate to the main character. For example, once he got shot.
