snippet: One of my favorite things about growing up here is the Christmas Parade.

One of my favorite things about growing up here is the Christmas Parade. Every year the Methodist Church does a breakfast with Santa; it’s right before the parade, and as kids we would always go to this breakfast and then to the Parade. As we got older, sometimes we’d be in the parade. It’s one of my favorite things about this area; it really brings the community together.

Over the years since then, I’ve been really proud of what I’ve accomplished with my business. It’s not an easy thing to get clients; sometimes I’ve sat here for the entire day with no customers. I feel like I’ve come a long way. One of my favorite things about this business is how many different people I get to interact with. None of my customers are the same. I get to meet all kinds of people.
