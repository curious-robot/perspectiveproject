snippet: I remember the first Possum Drop in Brasstown. 
---
I remember back when we did the first Possum Drop in Brasstown. [Every New Year’s Eve, instead of a Ball Drop in New York, we have a Possum Drop in Brasstown]. Back then there were only about twenty of us. I remember Clay asking when we should lower the possum, and we looked at our watches and said “Clay… it’s five after twelve.” So he said, “I guess we better hurry up and drop this thing.” We finally lowered the possum. It’s really grown over the years, now it’s a big deal.
