One really important thing to me is the environment. I started doing environmental science for my undergrad, but I couldn’t really get through the chemistry, so I ended up doing business economics. Even so, the environment has always been something I’ve been involved in. I helped with river-way cleanups and stuff like that. And I think sometimes people don’t respect the environment as much as they should. We’re doing a lot to the world that we need to fix.

When we left Fort Lauderdale on Wednesday, it was one in the morning. It took us 20 hours to get here. On the way up all the rest stops, hotels, and motels were full, so we just kept going. We took naps by the side of the road occasionally. We even had to take a lot of side roads because the main highways were so backed up. I’d always said I wouldn’t stay for a hurricane that was over a category three, so it was really a simple decision to leave for Irma. But it did take a lot of convincing to get my husband to go. Gas and water were already starting to run out, and that was when the storm was still 4 or 5 days away. I basically just packed four days of clothes, our children, and my husband! Oh, and our dog!
