I only recently figured out what I want to do with my life. Finding out where I want to stay for the rest of my life, finding out who I want to help and how I want to help them. And finding out who I want to stay with. It took all of high school to figure that out. When I was a freshman I wanted to be a veterinarian, but in my junior year I started tutoring people and that’s when I started to realize that’s what I wanted to do for the rest of my life: teach people to understand and fall in love with math. I started a student-led tutoring program at my high school that focused on tutoring kids according to how they learned. I had one girl who dreaded coming to tutoring when she first started, but by the end of it she was excited to come. It wasn’t until this last year that I figured out where I want to stay. I want to come back to Murphy after college and teach mathematics at the community college.

I’ve learned not to give up so easily. Don’t think that you’re not going to accomplish something. Don’t believe what everyone tells you.
