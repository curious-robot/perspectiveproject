After about 3 years of living in Florida, we missed the fall season so we came up and rented a place in North Georgia for a week. Some people told us that if we were going to North Georgia we ought to go into North Carolina and go to Murphy. We drove into town looking for coffee and saw the coffee sign and came in here. The owners of the coffee shop at the time were so kind and friendly we just fell in love with the area and ended up buying a lot.
